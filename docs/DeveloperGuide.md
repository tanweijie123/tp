Welcome to FitEgo! This document will serve as a developer guide to the all-in-one scheduling application. This is to encourage and guide interested parties who wish to extend FitEgo and improve its features.

Made with **fitness instructors** in mind, **FitEgo** is a **desktop program** that helps them **manage their clients and schedules**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, **FitEgo** can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `cdel 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram of the Logic Component](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `Homepage` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx and ControlsFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component interacts with these external API: 

* `Logic` : Performs the Execution of user's commands.
* `Model` : Listens for changes to data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. deleting a Client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cdel 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cdel 1` Command](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` and `DeleteClientCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The figure above gives the overall architecture of the Model component.

![Structure of the Model Component - continued](images/ModelClassDiagram2.png)

The figure above gives a more detailed class diagram for each of the Client, Session and Schedule packages.

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels 
and logging destinations.

- The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file 
(See [Section 3.2](#configuration), “Configuration”)
- The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according 
to the specified logging level
- Currently log messages are output through both `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

- **SEVERE** : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
- **WARNING** : Can continue, but with caution
- **INFO** : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
- **FINE** : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging 
e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled(e.g. user prefs file location, logging level), 
through the configuration file (default: `config.json`)

### Edit Session feature

The proposed Edit Session mechanism is facilitated by `Addressbook`.

These operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setSession()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Edit Session mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial client, session and schedule list.

Step 2. The user executes `sedit 1 g/coolgym` command to edit the first Session in the address book. 
The `sedit` command calls `Model#setSession()`, causing changes to be made in the address book after the `sedit 1 g/coolgym` command executes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Edit Session operation works:

![EditSessionSequenceDiagram](images/EditSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditSessionCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `EditSession` command, with the assumption that the user inputs a valid command:

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
    <p>
        <img src="images/EditSessionActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 25%; height: auto;"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure - Edit Session Activity Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

### Delete Session feature

The Delete Session feature allows user to cancel a Session, and delete all Schedules associated to the Session.

#### Implementation

The Delete Session mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteSessionCommand` which extends `Command`. The format of the 
command is given by: 

```sdel INDEX [f/]```

When using this command, the `INDEX` should refer to the index shown in the Session List on the right panel.
The user can follow up with an optional force parameters to delete all Schedules associated to the Session.

These delete operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteSession`, `Model#deleteSessionAssociatedSchedules`
and `Model#hasAnyScheduleAssociatedWithSession`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `DeleteSession` command, with the assumption that the user inputs a valid command.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
    <p>
        <img src="images/DeleteSessionActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure - Delete Session Activity Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

The following diagram shows a possible application state in FitEgo. 

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
    <p>
        <img src="images/tracing/DeleteSessionObjectDiagram.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure - A possible application state</figcaption>
</figure>

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution when the user decides to enter the Delete Session command 
`sdel 1 f/` into FitEgo with the above scenario, where the first Session in the Session List is the `enduranceTraining` Session. 
For simplicity, we will refer to this command input as `commandText`. 

![DeleteSessionSequenceDiagram](images/tracing/DeleteSessionSequenceDiagram.png)

![DeleteSessionParseArgsRef](images/tracing/DeleteSessionParseArgsRef.png)
 
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteSessionCommand` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagram above shows how the `DeleteSessionCommand` is executed in FitEgo. The LogicManager receives user 
command as commandText and parses it with `AddressBookParser`. It will parse the command and pass the remaining
arguments to `DeleteSessionCommandParser` to construct a `DeleteSessionCommand`. This `DeleteSessionCommand` is 
returned to the `LogicManager` which will then executes it with reference to the model argument.

The model will first get the current `FilteredSessionList` instance to get the Session to be deleted. It will then check
whether there exist any `Schedule` associated to the Session. As there are currently 2 schedules associated to the "enduranceTraining" session in FitEgo and the boolean `isForced` 
is set to true, the model will remove them from `AddressBook`. It will then create a `CommandResult` to relay feedback 
message back to the UI and return control back to `LogicManager`. It will persist these changes by saving it to the storage.

#### Design Considerations

In designing this feature, we had to consider several alternative ways in which we can choose to handle session deletion.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete Session only after all associated Schedules are deleted.
    
    - Pros: 
        1. Easier to maintain data integrity.
    - Cons:
        1. Extra logic inside the method implementation.
        2. May have performance issues in terms of response time if there are a lot of Schedules or Sessions stored in FitEgo.
    
- **Alternative 2:** Mark Session as deleted and treat Schedules with deleted Session as invalid
    
    - Pros: 
        1. Easier to implement the method. 
        2. No need to handle additional force flag option.
    - Cons: 
        1. We must keep track of deleted Sessions, which might bloat up the application over time.
        2. Harder to maintain data integrity over time.
        
- **Alternative 3:** Delete the Session without checking for associated Schedules

    - Pros: Easy to implement.
    - Cons: A Schedule might have invalid Session, breaking data integrity.


### Add Schedule feature

The Add Schedule feature allows user to create a Schedule associated with a Client and a Session. 
In other words, it allows user to schedule a Client to a Session.

#### Implementation

The Add Schedule mechanism is facilitated by `AddScheduleCommand` which extends `Command`. The format of the 
command is given by: 

```schadd c/CLIENT_INDEX s/SESSION_INDEX```

When using this command, the `CLIENT_INDEX` should refer to the index shown in the Client List on the left panel, and is used to specify the Client. The `SESSION_INDEX` should refer to the index shown in the Session List on the right panel, and is used to specify the Session.

The following activity diagram summarizes the decision making process when a user executes a new `AddSchedule` command.

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
     <p>
         <img src="images/AddScheduleActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure - Add Schedule activity diagram</figcaption>
 </figure>

#### Command Usage Examples

Assume the current state of the displayed Client List, displayed Session List, and Schedules (all Schedules in FitEgo) are as illustrated on the following simplified object diagram:

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
     <p>
         <img src="images/OverlappingScheduleObjectDiagram0.png" style="width: 95%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure - Sample current state of Add Schedule</figcaption>
 </figure>

Now, consider two cases of Add Schedule command to be invoked.

**Case 1**:  `schadd c/2 s/1`

Here is what happens when `schadd c/2 s/1` is invoked.

The overall mechanism is similar to [Delete Session](#delete-session-feature), but mainly differs on the method call `parseCommand` and `DeleteSessionCommand#execute(model)`.

`parseCommand` method call:
Instead of using `DeleteSessionCommandParser`, it uses `AddScheduleCommandParser` such that it returns an `AddScheduleCommand` object called `a` with Client index `2` and Session index `1`.

`AddScheduleCommand#execute(model)` will be called instead of `DeleteSessionCommand#execute(model)`:
This method call can be traced by the following sequence diagram snippet.

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
     <p>
         <img src="images/AddScheduleExecuteRef.png" style="width: 95%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure - Sequence diagram snippet for <code>AddScheduleCommand#execute(model)</code></figcaption>
 </figure>
 
As shown in the figure above, first it gets the Client and Session from the filtered (displayed) lists. Then, it checks for existing identical Schedule (Schedule that consists of the same Client and Session) using `hasAnyScheduleAssociatedWithClientAndSession()`. 
Since for this case it is not found, then create a new Schedule object and add it into the Model using `Model#addSchedule()`. Finally, return the CommandResult to indicate a success.

Thus, `schadd c/2 s/1` will add a Schedule associated with Andy (the second Client in the Client List) and endurance training from 12/12/2020 1400 - 1600 (the first Session in the Session List). The result can be illustrated by the following object diagram, which creates a new Schedule:

 <figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
     <p>
         <img src="images/OverlappingScheduleObjectDiagram1.png" style="width: 95%; height: auto;"/>
     </p>
     <figcaption>Figure - Result of invoking <code>schadd c/2 s/1</code></figcaption>
 </figure>

**Case 2:** `schadd c/1 s/1`

On the other hand, invoking `schadd c/1 s/1` will result in an error shown to the user as an identical Schedule already exists. Here, John is already scheduled to the endurance training Session from 12/12/2020 1400 - 1600.

### Edit Schedule feature

The proposed Edit Schedule mechanism is facilitated by `Addressbook`, similar to the Edit Session Command.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setSchedule()`.

Similar to the Edit Session mechanism, the example usage scenario below shows how Edit Schedule mechanism behaves:

The user executes `schedit c/1 s/1 us/2` command to edit the Schedule with the first Session and first Client in the address book. 
The `schedit` command calls `Model#setSchedule()`, causing changes to be made in the address book after the `schedit c/1 s/1 us/2` command executes.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `EditSchedule` command, with the assumption that the user inputs a valid command:

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
    <p>
        <img src="images/EditScheduleActivityDiagram.png" style="width: 25%; height: auto;"/>
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure - Edit Schedule Activity Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How edit schedule executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieve Schedule using Client and Session Index.
  * Pros: Clearer to retrieve.
  * Cons: Require user to know the Client and Session Index separately.

* **Alternative 2:** Retrieve Schedule using Schedule Index
  itself.
  * Pros: Easier to retrieve.
  * Cons: Implementation is more confusing as User there's a conflict between Index and user-typed String index.


### View Client's Weight feature

The viewing of client's weight feature allows the user to check in on a Client's progress after multiple Sessions.
This data is important because it allows the user to check the effectiveness of his training schedule and customise the training 
based on the remarks and weight progress. 

Viewing of Client's Weight is accessible when the user calls `cview [INDEX]` followed by activating the `Weight` tab pane. 

#### Implementation

The recording of weight is stored in `Schedule` class. This is because we believe that trainer would optionally take a weight measurement
at the start of every session. Thus, to get the weight change over time, a list of schedules related to the `Client` has to be extracted. 

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution starting from when the user calls `cview 1` until when the UI is updated with Client View.

<figure style="width:auto; text-align:center; padding:0.5em; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller;">
    <p>
        <img src="images/ClientViewWeightSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ClientViewWeightSequenceDiagram" style="align-content: center" />
    </p>
    <figcaption>Figure - Client View Weight Generate Sequence Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

The steps used to create CommandResult is omitted in the sequence diagram for clarity of diagram. The return object of `logic.execute("cview 1")`
is a CommandResult object, within which, contains a Supplier which returns a Pane for MainWindow to display when activated.

</div>

As shown in the "alt" frame, the chart is added into the tab pane if there are associated schedule and the weight (if present within the `Schedule` object)
will be added into the line chart. Otherwise, the `Weight` tab will be removed instead of showing an empty chart.  

#### Design Considerations
In designing this weight tracking feature, we had considered several alternative ways in which we can store and retreive the weight. 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `Weight` within the `Schedule` object
  * Pros: The user can track the weight against each session attended. 
  * Cons: Multiple weight measurement during a session, and weight measurement without a session cannot be entered. 
  
* **Alternative 2:** Stores a list of `Weight` within the `Client` object
  * Pros: Do not require a schedule in order to track weight. 
  * Cons: Lesser information about the weight (schedule's exercise, remarks, time, etc) is stored.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* is a fitness instructor who has trouble managing a significant number of clients and sessions
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* favours an All-in-One software over multiple apps
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps while appreciates a nice GUI that can show his weekly schedule
* prefers a simple and minimalistic view, as he does not like clutters.

**Value proposition**: to help a fitness instructor keeps track of his customers easily, via CLI as he’s a fast typer.
He can spend more time on his clients/his routine rather than manually using alternative software like Excel to track
administrative matters.
