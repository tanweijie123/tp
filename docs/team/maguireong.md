## Project: FitEgo

FitEgo is a desktop application for fitness instructors to keep track of his/her customers easily, so that he can spend more time on his clients/his routine rather than manually tracking administrative matters using alternative software like Excel.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a session created by the user.
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit a session’s details like a session’s gym name, exercise type, start time and duration.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a client may have changes made to his/her workout session, therefore the app should provide a way to make changes to the session.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
                It builds the foundation for edit features in FitEgo. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a schedule created by the user.
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit a schedule’s details like a schedule’s updated session index, payment status, remark and weight.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may have changes made to his schedules, therefore the app should provide a way to make update the changes to the schedule.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was similar to the edit session feature, therefore I had less trouble trying to create this feature. 
                However, the implementation too was slightly different form the edit session feature, therefore more time was required to create this feature.
  * Credits: {Credits to teammates Bennett and Dhafin for adding additional parameters that can be edited in the feature}

* **New Feature**: Added a dynamic header on the right side panel.
  * What it does: Allows the user to have a better idea of the time period searched for when using the “Session View” function.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can better identify which time period it is referring to.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of JavaFX.
                The implementation too was challenging enough as a new user to JavaFX.
