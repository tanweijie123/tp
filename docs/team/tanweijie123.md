## Project: FitEgo

FitEgo is a desktop scheduling application catered for personal, recreational, sports and competitive instructors.
They may use this software to ease the hassle of managing clients and their schedule. The user interacts with it mainly using CLI,
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to auto-complete commands while the user is typing. (Pull requests [\#99](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/99))
  * What it does: allows the user to view the commands available in FitEgo during mid-typing, so that forgetful users can refer to it. Advanced users can also use the "TAB" key to lessen the typing. 
  * Justification: This feature makes it user-friendly because new users are guided to available commands, and advanced users can type lesser. 
  * Credits: ControlsFX library was used to display the available commands in a table-list format. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to warn users if their data file is not in the correct format (Pull requests [\#251](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/251))
  * What it does: warns the user if FitEgo is unable to parse the data from the data file. Allows the user to exit immediately to prevent data file being overwritten. 
  * Justification: This feature protects the user's data file and prevents unrecoverable damages. 

* **New Feature**: Added the feature to track weight for every schedule (Pull requests [\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/159))
  * What it does: allows the user to store weight for every schedule. Then, the user can view the weight over time using a line chart. 

* **New Feature**: Added the feature to view client's full information (Pull requests [\#60](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/60), [\#77](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/77), [\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/159))
  * What it does: allows the user to view the client's profile, schedules, and weight over time. 
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to track the client's progress so that he does not have to utilise another software or perform calculations manually. 
  * Credits: With the help of Kelvin (adding different weight units) and Bennett (displaying all schedule related to the clients in a table), I had managed to integrate both of their work into a tab-pane. 

[comments]: <> (Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys. - PR#99)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:

  * Changed the `AddressBookParser` class to use hashmap and functions (Pull requests [\#84](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/84))
  * Changed `UniqueClientList` into generics (Pull requests [\#75](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/75))
  * Modify `find` to include partial substring (Pull requests [\#54](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/54))
  * Modify saving to storage to include `Session` objects (Pull requests [\#70](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/70), [\#71](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/71), [\#73](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/73))
  * Modify sample data initialisation to use dynamic dates (Pull requests [\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/159))
